                    The process is simple and seamless. First, users need to
                    verify their wallet on the platform. Once verified, they can
                    choose the specific NFT they wish to transform into tangible
                    merchandise. Next, users define the type of goodies they
                    want to create, whether it's art prints, apparel,
                    collectibles, or more. They also set the license fees,
                    allowing them to earn royalties from each sale. Finally,
                    users specify the quantity of goodies they want to mint,
                    giving them the flexibility to create limited editions or
                    larger collections. With these steps complete, Blockright
                    transforms the digital art into real-world goodies, ready to
                    be cherished and collected by art enthusiasts worldwide.

                    If you have sold or transferred your NFT to a new owner,
                    Blockright ensures that you still receive a fair share of
                    the secondary fees. Specifically, you will receive 50% of
                    the secondary fees generated from minted goods. The
                    remaining 50% of the secondary fees will be transferred to
                    the new or current holder of the NFT. This way, you continue
                    to benefit from your original creation, even after it
                    changes hands. As your NFT gains popularity and value, you
                    can earn passive income from the subsequent transactions
                    involving your digital art. Blockright's system is designed
